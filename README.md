# housing_price_regression_XGB

 In this project, I delved into the fascinating world of real estate by employing the powerful XGBoost algorithm to develop a robust regression model.
 By leveraging a comprehensive dataset of housing features and prices, I aimed to accurately predict the values of residential properties.
 Through rigorous data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization, I sought to uncover the key factors influencing housing prices and provide valuable insights for home owners, buyers, and real estate professionals.
